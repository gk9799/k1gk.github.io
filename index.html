            <h3>Hello! I am <span style="color: #78489E;"><b>Grace Kim &#x2615;</b></span>, an aspiring <span style="color: #F5BD41;"><b>UX / UI Designer</b><span>.</h3>
            <p>I am currently majoring in Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University. As a student who aspires to work in the UI field, my goal is to become a designer who can offer users products designed based on deep understanding and empathy. The more I learn, the more I realize how challenging it is to design for and design with users. However, I would love to make their lives easier and merrier with my visual design and user experience design skills!<br><br>

            Throughout the years in SFU, Iâ€™ve experienced designing with <b>Figma</b> and <b>Adobe Creative Suite</b> and gained basic coding skills in <b>HTML&CSS</b>, <b>PHP</b> and <b>MySQL</b>. I am aware that there are still a lot of additional design skills and tools I should learn as designs evolve and user preferences changes. I am looking forward to learning and employing those skills for a better user-friendly world : )</p>
