            <h3>Hello! I am <span style="color: #78489E;"><b>Grace Kim &#x2615;</b></span>, an aspiring <span style="color: #F5BD41;"><b>UX / UI Designer</b><span>.</h3>

            <p>Aside from delightful design processes, I appreciate adorable creatures (especially cats!), a glimpse of relaxing nature in the middle of busy routines, sincere friends and loving family, and photography that portrays humane genuineness. In terms of my professional self, I am a passionate UX design student studying Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University. I value effectiveness and efficiency when it gets to design. My ultimate goal is to become a designer who offers users the most in-depth understanding and empathy.
            <br><br>
            Throughout the years in SFU, I gained experience designing with <b>Figma</b> and <b>Adobe Creative Suite</b>, as well as front-end development skills using <b>HTML&CSS</b> and foundational knowledge of <b>PHP</b> and <b>MySQL</b>. The more I learn, the more I realize how challenging it is to design for and with all users. Still, I would love to offer many lives a more comfortable and merrier experience with my UX design and visual design skills, as a tiny contribution to a better and more beautiful world!</p>
