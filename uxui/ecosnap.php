            <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                In an Interface Design course, I proposed and designed an interface as a member of a team of 5 (Seansky, Celine, Lucy, Eva, and myself). Our team chose sustainability as our domain after research and came up with an app called EcoSnap. <br><br>
                For a given 7 weeks, we did research on sustainability and cleanup volunteers, interviewed the potential audience, ideated based on the research and the interviews, refined our ideas, and designed an interface. Our team worked synchronously and asynchronously mostly on Figma and also on Protopie for the prototype for the last couple of weeks. <br><br>
                Most of us contributed in almost all areas but worked more in-depth in our specialties. For example, I participated in the research, content, wire flows, mockups, and basic interactions (on Figma) of the app with other members, but on top of that, I mainly worked with the visuals and the presentation slides for each week.

                    <h4>Objective</h4>
                    <p>
                    EcoSnap's ultimate goal is to keep local coastlines clean and vibrant. People do not take the region's beautiful coastline for granted but have a responsibility to preserve it as it is today for the enjoyment of others, especially our descendants. EcoSnap allows users to report beaches and coastlines in need of environmental cleanup by taking a photo and writing a brief description of the area.

                    <h4>Process</h4>
                    <p>
                    Our group aimed to create a platform that allows users to easily report and form and/or participate in cleanup groups. We tried to keep the processes as simple as possible.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="content_obj_subsection">Research & Interviews</h4>
                    <p>
                    We focused on researching and interviewing the potential audiences for the first two weeks. Our group not only was able to conduct several interviews with the potential users but also I, along with two other members of our team (Seansky and Celine) participated in a meeting with the waste committee at the Society Promoting Environmental Protection (SPEC). We learned what the stakeholder looks for from cleanup events (they care a lot about the environment and the whole process of cleanup including how the collected wastes would be processed) and the feedback, especially on the weaknesses of EcoSnap from their point of view. (Overall, the committees liked our interface idea!)
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="content_obj_subsection">Wireflows, Mockups & Prototype</h4>
                    <p>
                    Based on the research, interviews, and the meeting with SPEC, our group refined our interface idea and finalized a total of five features. The two core features are reporting and participating. The users can report dump areas and/or participate in cleanup groups using EcoSnap. There are three additional features; a calendar to view cleanup schedules, an About page to learn more about EcoSnap and how the users can protect the environment using EcoSnap, and lastly, a Profile page for the users to be more engaged by earning badges that show the usersâ€™ past contributions. The users could also download or share their volunteer certificates in the profile feature. I was in charge of the About page to introduce EcoSnap and its goals. The whole team participated in the wire flows and mockups of the entire app together. Then, while I worked on basic interactions on Figma with other members, one member worked on more complicated interactions on Protopie.

                    <h4 class="content_obj_subsection">User Testing & Final Polishing</h4>
                    <p>
                    I conducted 6 user tests after we finished designing all features. Based on the feedback our team members and I got after user testing, I improved the visuals while other members fixed minor errors in the features. Finally, our team presented EcoSnap in the last class.

                    <h4>Challenge</h4>
                    <h4 class="content_obj_subsection">Schedule Management</h4>
                    <p>
                    The interface Design course offered me to experience all the processes of designing an app. The challenge our group faced that triggered us to struggle with the entire project schedule was to come up with an interesting and innovative idea that does not commonly exist. We ended up choosing our idea at the end of the second week so we were tight on schedule. The designs for the first few weeks did not look good due to the reason so it was frustrating for all of us. However, as our group dedicated more time to this project to catch up with the schedule, our app improved. At this phase, I finished my part early and experimented on the colour scheme for EcoSnap. I also proposed several logo designs and navigation bar designs and created icons while other members worked on their wire flows. Finalizing visual elements was important for us as we needed to create mockups. Choosing colours and designing visuals took some time and required patience, but it felt so satisfying after finalizing them.

                    <p>
                    Although our group had a rough beginning, I enjoyed the whole process of designing an interface and I am also satisfied with the outcome we presented. Throughout this project, I learned more about what I am capable of and what I should improve in terms of skills. The Interface Design course inspired me to aspire to become a UI designer specifically. <br><br>
                    There are several ideas to improve EcoSnap in the future. As one of the SPEC committees suggested, EcoSnap could record the kinds and the amount of waste collected for the statistics. This analysis would motivate the users by showing their contributions in actual numbers. EcoSnap could also allow the users to connect with other users to form a community that shares common interests. During the user testing, our group learned that some participants felt EcoSnap was like a small community that gives a sense of belonging. Allowing users to connect with each other would increase participation as well.
